# Hello.

Every business from startup to corporate needs a website. Although I just entered this industry, I've already designed six websites and won three golden Addy awards from the American Advertising Federation. I know how to not just make a website using Wordpress, but also how to implement effective SEO and social media intergration. I hope to keep learning new skills in this industry, with the goal of eventually being able to comfortably transfer any idea I have into a tangible website.

# Who is Travis?

Travis Trout is an advertising major from the University of Florida. He has over two years of experience in Web Design with Wordpress, but is now transitioning into Web Development by learning how to make Custom Plugins with PHP, improving Custom CSS usage, programming with web APIs, and interacting with MySQL servers.

# What has he done?

Travis has worked primarily in Panama City Beach, Florida designing and implementing SEO for the following websites:
* [Sharky's Beach Restaurant](https://sharkysbeach.com)
* [Rock'It Lanes Bowling Alley](https://rockitlanes.com)
* [Seahaven Resorts](https://seahavenbeach.com)
* [Smity's Barbecue](https://smittysbarbecue.com)
* [Ara Lake Camp](https://aralakecamp.com)
* [Riverview Plastic Surgery](https://riverviewplastics.com)

Along with their design, he also edited many of the images using Photoshop.

# What is he doing now?

Travis is currently developing a website called [Silent.marketing](https://silent.marketing).
This is his own personal project with the goal of becoming the basis for an independent company.

It requires more skills than he currently has practiced, resulting in slower development time. Regardless, the following has been achieved:
 - [x] Established web hosting with a custom domain and DNSSEC as well as SSL security.
 - [x] Created a custom plugin hooked into Woocommerce that will allow dynamic pricing based on text input.
 - [x] Connected plugin to multiple social-networking web APIs.
 - [ ] Compare user input with existing items in MySQL database.
 - [ ] Create a webcrawler that can pull from MySQL database.
 
 So far, he has had to restart his program three times, resulting in him learning how to use bash, Javafx, CURL, PHP, and FTP.
